Content
-------

Call `ax()` with content and it will be rendered to the DOM.

EG(hello_world)

Normally `ax()` is called with a function as an argument. The function is, in turn, called with two arguments: a Tag Builder and an Extensions Object. These are often assigned as `a` and `x `.



EG(tag_builder)





EG(hello_world2)


The Extensions Object is used to access Ax extensions, such as routers, form builders, and transitions.

EG(form)
